Hosting expm Repository
=======================

It's fairly straightforward. Check out expm repository, run `make`, copy `sys.config.sample.exs` to `sys.config.exs` and edit it and run `make start`.

By default, it will run its own independent repository. If you, however, want to become a mirror, put something like this into your `sys.config.exs`:

```erlang
 repository: quote do: Expm.Repository.Mirror.new(source: (Expm.Repository.HTTP.new url: "http://expm.co"), destination: Expm.Repository.DETS.new(filename: "expm.dat"), frequency: 1000*60),
```

This will download expm.co's repository every minute.
